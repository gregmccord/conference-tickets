## Overview

This is a solution to the [Conference ticket generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w).

### Process

I used Vite to set up this React project. react-dropzone is used to handle file uploads.

### Sample View

Try and maintain parity with target implementation

TODO: have comparisons of both pages

### Running Locally

When running locally via npm,
- To start the server, execute 'npm run dev' (launches on port 5173 by default)
- For file formatting, execute 'npm run format'
- If you'd like a stock image to test with, feel free to use this one provided by Frontend Mentor

## Personal Goals

### Learn and Develop Skillset

- Refresh on React programming as I am more comfortable with backend work.
- Use a predesigned stylistic template as a model and go from there.
- Test edge cases rigorously.
- Build a multi-page (relatively static) website from the ground up.

### Maintain proper code structure

src/
  assets/         # Images, fonts, and other static files
  components/     # Reusable UI components
  contexts/       # Components with state and logic, often connected to data
  pages/          # Top-level components representing different application routes
  services/       # API calls and data fetching logic
  utils/          # Helper functions and utilities
  styles/         # Global styles or CSS modules
  app.jsx         # Root component and application setup
  index.js        # Entry point of the application
